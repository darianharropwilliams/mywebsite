  "description": "I'm a Charlottesville native raised in a sports-loving, tight-knit family. Iâ€™m driven by a love for learning and the satisfaction of building things from scratch. Curiosity and open-mindedness guide how I approach both technology and life. My current goal is to grow into a well-rounded tech professional while continuing to explore new tools and ideas. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, solving puzzles, and staying active by playing baskeball."
