  "description": "I'm a Charlottesville native raised in a sports-loving, tight-knit family. Iâ€™m driven by a love for learning and the satisfaction of building things from scratch. Curiosity and open-mindedness guide how I approach both technology and life. I'm a Virginia Tech alum, and my current goal is to grow into a well-rounded tech professional while continuing to explore new tools and ideas. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, solving puzzles, and staying active by playing basketball.",

  "aboutCoding": "I grew up fascinated by engineering and robotics. Building things that moved and solved problems always excited me. I studied engineering in community college, but ultimately chose Computer Science for its accessibility and the creative ownership it gives. With just a keyboard, I could design, build, and test complete systems on my own. That immediacy and independence are what keep me hooked."
